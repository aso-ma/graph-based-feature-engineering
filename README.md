# graph-based-feature-engineering

This approach involves generating a similarity graph from tabular data entities. It extracts hand-crafted, graph-based features from the similarity graph and combines these new features with the primary features to enhance the performance of the classification task.

The graph-based features utilized in this implementation include:
- Node centrality based feature
- Community detection based feature
